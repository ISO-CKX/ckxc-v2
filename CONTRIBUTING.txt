                                 ckxc contributing guide

Code style:
    0. Always use FOUR SPACES except in makefiles.
    1. Use C/C++ as a development language, but don't be too C.
    2. STL and STL algorithms are preferred. If you can't find some kinds of
  wheels, add them to library sona.
    3. Identifiers for ckxc:
        classes/functions: Parser, Sema, ActOnReturnStmt
        variables/paramaters: value, currentContext, varName, i/j/k
        data members: mParser, mSema, mCurrentContext
        constants/enumerators: MaxDeclsAllowed
        macroes: SUM_AND_SQUARE

       Identifiers for sona (important): please do as what STL does.
