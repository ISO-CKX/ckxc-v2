                                 ckxc contributing guide

Code style:
    0. Always use TWO SPACES except in makefiles.
    1. Use C/C++ as a development language, but don't be too C.
    2. STL and STL algorithms are preferred. If you can't find some kinds of
       wheels, add them to library sona.
    3. Identifiers for ckxc:
        classes/functions: Parser, Sema, ActOnReturnStmt
        unsafe functions: GetExprUnsafe
        variables/paramaters: value, currentContext, varName, i/j/k
        data members: m_Parser, m_Sema, m_CurrentContext
        constants/enumerators: MaxDeclsAllowed
        macroes: SUM_AND_SQUARE

       Identifiers for sona (important): please do as what STL does.
